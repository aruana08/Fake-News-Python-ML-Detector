# Fake-News-Python-ML-Detector
Developed a fake news detection model using Kaggle datasets, applying TF-IDF vectorization, regex-based text cleaning, and multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to distinguish between real and fake news


Leveraging two Kaggle datasets—one featuring fake news and the other genuine articles—I applied comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for analysis. Using TF-IDF vectorization to capture word importance and regex-based text cleaning to refine the dataset, I established a strong foundation for model development.

I then implemented and evaluated multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, to assess their effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news articles.
